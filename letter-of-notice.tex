\opening{Dear MANAGERSNAME,}

I wish to give one month's notice of resignation with effect from today.

I would like to thank you and everyone at COMPANYNAME for the opportunities,
support, and guidance I have received since joining the Company. If there are
any areas in particular that you would like me to focus on during my notice
period, please let me know.

I hope I can rely on you for a positive reference in future.

\closing{Many thanks,}

\end{letter}
